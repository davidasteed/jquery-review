# jquery-review

## Purpose:  Review JQuery for interview prep and for future reference

## Functionality
1.  Using native JavaScript:  
  - Traverse the dom and print out a NodeList object containing all `<p>` elements.
  - Append a new paragraph.

2.  Using JQuery:
  - Listen for left or right arrow keydown events.
  - When they occur, shift all `<li>` elements to the left or right, but keeping the movement range between the starting location, and 500px to the left.

## Developer:  David Steed
